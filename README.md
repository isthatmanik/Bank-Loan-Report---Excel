# Bank Loan Report - Dashboard (Excel)

Over the past few weeks, I’ve been diving deep into the world of data analysis and Excel, and I’m thrilled to share some of the key insights and dashboards I’ve created as part of my learning journey.

I recently worked on a Bank Loan Report project, where I tackled real-world problems and built comprehensive dashboards to analyze lending activities and loan performance. Here’s a glimpse of what I accomplished:

---

## Key Challenges & Solutions:

### 1️⃣ Dashboard 1: Summary

- Calculated critical KPIs like Total Loan Applications, Total Funded Amount, and Average Interest Rate.

- Monitored Month-to-Date (MTD) and Month-over-Month (MoM) changes to track trends and performance.

- Differentiated between Good Loans (Fully Paid, Current) and Bad Loans (Charged Off) to assess loan portfolio health.

### 2️⃣ Dashboard 2: Overview

- Created visualizations like Line Charts for monthly trends, Filled Maps for regional analysis, and Donut Charts for loan term distribution.

- Analyzed loan metrics by employee length, loan purpose, and home ownership using Bar Charts and Tree Maps.

- Identified seasonality, regional disparities, and borrower behavior patterns to inform lending strategies.

### 3️⃣ Dashboard 3: Details

- Built a consolidated view of all loan-related metrics, providing a one-stop solution for detailed insights into loan performance and borrower profiles.
